# miniRT

**miniRT** is a simplified 3D raytracer project from the 42 curriculum. The program reads a scene description from a file, parses objects, lights, and camera information, and renders a 3D image using ray tracing. It supports spheres, planes, cylinders, lights, shadows, reflections, and basic camera controls.  

## Features

- Scene parsing with validation for objects, lights, and camera  
- Ray tracing with shadows and lighting  
- Support for spheres, planes, and cylinders  
- Simple rendering with MiniLibX  
- Keyboard controls for camera movement and window updates  
- Memory-safe and robust against invalid input  

## Program Rules
- Scene files must define at least one camera, one light, and one object  
- Only valid coordinates, directions, and colors are accepted  
- The program opens a window and renders the scene in real time  
- Actions and updates are handled via keyboard input  

## Build & Run


1. Navigate to the project directory:  
```
git clone https://github.com/Yuxin29/my_miniRT.git miniRT
cd miniRT
```
    
2. Compile using the provided Makefile:
```
make    #Generates the executable miniRT
```
Available make commands:
```
make clean   # Remove object files
make fclean  # Remove object files and executable
make re      # Recompile everything from scratch
```

3. Running the Program
```
./miniRT [scene.rt]
Example:
./miniRT scenes/test_scene.rt    # This reads the scene description and opens a window rendering the 3D scene.
```
## Scene File Format (.rt)

- Contains definitions for:
  - Camera: C x,y,z dirX,dirY,dirZ fov
  - Light: L x,y,z brightness r,g,b
  - Sphere: sp x,y,z diameter r,g,b
  - Plane: pl x,y,z normalX,normalY,normalZ r,g,b
  - Cylinder: cy x,y,z dirX,dirY,dirZ diameter height r,g,b
- All coordinates, directions, and colors must be valid numbers.
- The program will ignore malformed lines and print errors if necessary.
